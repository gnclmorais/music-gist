# Music Gist
Search for an artist or band and youâ€™ll get the gist of it.

## Motivation
Tired of opening Last.fm, Wikipedia, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, YouTube, and a few
others services when someone tells me about a new artist or band,
I thought about doing a simple web app that allowed me to
get to know a band in a few seconds. A small bio, genre tags and autoplay
seemed to be the mandatory first features, from my personal experience.

Built with Node.js, Express.js, Jade and Stylus. Supports [OpenSearch](http://opensearch.org). Uses [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) and [Last.fm](http://last.fm) APIs. Heavily relies on [flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox).

## Available audio sources and its priorities
1. SoundCloud (with autoplay)
1. YouTube
