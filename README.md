# Music Gist
Search for an artist or band and youâ€™ll get the gist of it.

## Motivation
Tired of opening Last.fm, Wikipedia, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, YouTube, and a few
others services when someone tells me about a new artist or band,
I thought about doing a simple web app that allowed me to
get to know a band in a few seconds. A small bio, genre tags and autoplay
seemed to me the mandatory first features, from my personal experience.

## Audio priority
1. Bandcamp
1. SoundCloud
1. Vimeo
1. YouTube
1. MySpace
